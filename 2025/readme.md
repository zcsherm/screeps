Refactor code - June 2025
-Have a better format for tasks.
-I like the idea of using a task manager to handle overarching plans and identifying needs
-2 types: Goals and Tasks
-Goals being where to setup extensions, turrets, road, where to mine etc
-Tasks being mining sources, feeding towers, repairing roads, constructing on spots
-A goal is accomplished via tasks.
-The planner would survey the room and identify immediate goals and longterm goals based on layout and level. It would then prioritize these goals and feed them to another agent: overseer
-The overseer would take these goals in priority, break them down into tasks, and then send these tasks to the task manager.
-The task manager would then assign creeps to each task, monitor each task for status and completion, raise errors when it identifies issues
-The 4th agent would be the monitor. 
-The monitor looks for emergent threats and situations. This might include invasions, dying creeps, dropped resources, destroyed buildings, empty extensions, full containers.
-It would then create tasks linked to these events and feed them to the task manager.
-The 5th agent is the safety
-The safety considers the current resiliency and raises alerts if resilience is compromised.
-Examples: Over production of creeps, running out of energy and unable to replenish stock of creeps (wind down of production, standstill), other agents entering a feedback loop
-A good practice might be to have each order for a new creep be checked by the safety first, try to determine if creating this creep may impact the current supply chain.
